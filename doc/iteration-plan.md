# Iteration 1 Plan

The main focus for iteration 1 is to create a functioning club search and calendar for the application that has good performance. 
Users should be able to search up and view club information while also being able to customize their calendar with meeting times and events. 
The calendar and club search is considered to be the most important part of the application and should be focused first. 
Most of the code will also be covered during testing with low chance of containing undetected bugs. There is also relatively low risk as 
most of the issues revolved around gathering data but dummy data can be used to test out the calendar and search. 

# Iteration 2 Plan

The main focus for iteration 2 is to improve search, add custom event functionality, implementing club regular meetings and allowing for filtering with the use of tags. 
Search should become less strict such to allow inexact matches in our search.
The custom event functionality will allow for non-official events to be added to user calendar.
Implementing the regular meetings for club in member's calendar. This may also require an override this week meetings method as well.
Filtering will be an extension of search so to allow broader or more specific searches.
With the addition of filter and tags, there may be new ways we can simplify our code once implemented. The code will also thoroughly be tested.
