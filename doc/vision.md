Purpose: To consolidate club information (meeting times, meeting location, event times, event location) and club
management into one application that is intuitive to use.

Main features:
1. Club search: allows users to find existing vassar organizations that are registered with the app.
The user can use a filter system that will sort clubs based on type and meeting times. Following from the club
search, users can click 'subscribe' and automatically join the mailing list (maybe) and 'register' as a member
of the club. The club search will yield information such as meeting time and location, and club members.

    2. Event timeline: shows relevant club events based on filters (club, event type, date, etc). The timeline is
       a personalized calendar that shows upcoming events and meetings with each user's registered club. This can also
       report timing conflicts for events that occur in the same time period.

    3. User profile: All users are able to perform personalization functions such as changing profile picture,
       Manage club registration (join or leave clubs), change password, and access a help (?) page that teaches
       users how to navigate the page.

    4. Club management: club executives are able to access the budget planner and can change the meeting time and
       location. The budget planner will follow constraints from the Vassar financial committee and the club's own
       available budget.

Constraints:
1. Gathering club info: hard to get existing club meeting times and locations
2. Approval: getting the application vetted and integrated into vassar website
3. Data management: need to store club info and personal user info
